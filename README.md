# Foundation Project 0.3.0.1

**Foundation Project**, Version 0.3.0.1

## Updates

1. **Improved Navigation:** I made the Treeview smoother to use, so you won't run into any hiccups while moving around.

2. **Fresher Look:** I've given the Menu section and food menu buttons a makeover with new images to make things look better.

3. **Less Annoying Pop-ups:** The portion window now closes properly when you click off it without choosing a size.

4. **One Window at a Time:** I've tidied things up by ensuring you'll only see one portion window open, no more clutter.

5. **No Errors:** I fixed some issues, including those annoying `ValueError` problems, and set "Small" as the default portion size for a smoother experience.

6. **Instant Prices:** Prices now update immediately as you add more products, making it easier to see how much you're spending.

7. **Bug Squashing:** I've been fixing various bugs to keep the app running smoothly. And also added more bugs to squash later on XD

8. **No More Karen:** Now owners can remove item from basket to satisfy their customers.
